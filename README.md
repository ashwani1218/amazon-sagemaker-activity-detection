# Using Amazon SageMaker for an Activity Detection Model Training and Inference on Video Livestream

This code repository contains two parts:

1. [Development](./development): It contains a Jupyter Notebook and its associated python source code to build, train and deploy an activity detection model using Amazon SageMaker. Transfer learning is used to fine-tune an MXNet-based pretrained 3D video classification model with another dataset.

2. [Deployment](./deployment): It contains CloudFormation templates and other resources to deploy an end-to-end activity detection solution using CloudFormation
